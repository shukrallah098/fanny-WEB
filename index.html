	The scary night
It was dark and snowy, nobody was there, I was going to mosque for pray but it was too strange because usually many people wanted to come for pray and mosque had light but that night nobody was there and the light was gone.

<mark>I went to ask from someone what is happening but i could not find someone and I thought maybe I am too early here, I went in toilet and wanted to ablution to get ready for pray but when I was getting ready I heard someone is screaming from mosque and went there to see what is happening I went in but nobody was there.</mark>

The way coming out I saw the girl who had black clothes and her face was not clear and I could not see her face, but I asked who are you and what is happening here but she did not answered.

She was just screaming and said go away I was afraid and run away, when I came out the left side was a shop and the right side was dark and snowy hoses, I decided to go in shop and relax myself, I was running and the same time heard the screaming and it was too cold.
I reached in the shop and asked for help but could not get answer I asked and asked but could not get answer, when I turned the girl was in front of me and felt hot like I got knife in my body and i woke up from my scary dream.
